if __name__ == "__main__":

# If the script is the "main" script then the special variable __name__ will
equal "__main__". You can use this to protect the "execution" code from the classes and variables the script has.
This enables you to import a script and use classes and variables without actually running that script's main code if it has any.
# if __name__ == "__main__" as a way to store code that should only run when your file is executed as a script.

The Pack geometry manager packs widgets relative to the earlier widget. Tkinter literally packs all the widgets
